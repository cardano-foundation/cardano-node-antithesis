# Tasks

Stable IDs, grouped by slice. A task is checked only after its slice is
audited and accepted by the ticket owner.

## S1 — controller-policy

- [x] T2151 Deterministic fake transport implementing the full operation
      surface with per-scenario observations and an append-only invocation log.
- [x] T2152 Controller stage machine with fail-closed exits and
      `CandidateReceiptV1` composition (I215-08, I215-09).
- [x] T2153 Observation validation for `resolve-upstream` and candidate-form
      validation for `publish-candidate` (I215-01, I215-02 form).
- [x] T2154 Topology census, equality, and stale-reference rejection over
      Compose-resolved rows; Compose-validation stage (I215-04, I215-05).
- [x] T2155 Submission-reachability control: exactly one fake submission on the
      complete path, zero in every negative control, and no real-submission
      operation anywhere (I215-06, I215-07).
- [x] T2156 Test suite with one named scenario per invariant and per negative
      control: wrong ref, wrong origin, malformed and ambiguous observation,
      publish failure, malformed candidate form, revision mismatch, stale
      topology override, missing service, zero census, Compose failure,
      unsupported mode, non-executable transport.

## S2 — github-transport

- [ ] T2161 Bare-remote observation and exact-rev Nix `dockerImage/node` build
      with GHCR publication under the full-SHA tag (R-01, R-02).
- [ ] T2162 Digest read-back and `CandidateRef` emission (I215-02).
- [ ] T2163 Containerized `cardano-node` revision proof (I215-03).
- [ ] T2164 Rendering of `cardano_node_master` into the state directory and
      Compose-resolved topology rows (I215-04, R-10).
- [ ] T2165 Compose validation, fake submission, and receipt persistence
      (I215-05, I215-07, I215-09).
- [ ] T2166 Credential handling confined to the effecting command's environment
      (I215-10).

## S3 — manual-entrypoint

- [ ] T2171 Manual `workflow_dispatch` candidate job running the real path with
      the fake submission transport and publishing the receipt (R-07).
- [ ] T2172 Pull-request job running only the hermetic test suite (R-09).
- [ ] T2173 Operator documentation naming the manual recovery entrypoint, each
      fail-closed stop, and the receipt fields (R-09).

## S1 — mandate v2 additions

- [x] T2157 Shipped mutation harness `tests/mutants/daily-cardano-node-head.sh`
      covering at minimum the thirteen auditor-established mutant ids, each
      verifying its own application, every one caught (I215-11):
      `I215-01-remove-observation-cardinality`, `I215-01-wrong-fixed-origin`,
      `I215-02-remove-tag-equality`, `I215-03-remove-revision-equality`,
      `I215-04-remove-zero-census-reason`,
      `I215-04-describe-ignores-rendered-model`,
      `I215-04-remove-node-image-equality`, `I215-05-validate-wrong-model`,
      `I215-06-duplicate-submit`, `I215-07-hidden-submission-client`,
      `I215-08-manual-specific-validation-target`,
      `I215-09-later-field-on-compose-failure`,
      `ENTRY-remove-transport-preflight`.
- [x] T2158 Spy-not-oracle fake transport and reason-token negative controls
      per `spec.md` "Proof architecture"; deterministic suite with no
      `printf | grep -q` pipefail race.

## S1 — mandate v3

- [x] T2159 Prove I215-07 by containment: run the complete suite inside an
      OS-enforced container with no network and no writable path outside its
      scratch root, fail closed when the mechanism is unavailable, and give the
      walls their own negative controls (a seeded outbound connection and a
      seeded write outside scratch must each fail the run). Remove the
      syscall-observation apparatus it replaces.
- [x] T2160 Construct the containment filesystem view from explicit binds
      instead of `--ro-bind / /` plus masking, so no pre-existing rendezvous
      object is reachable by name, and add a name-bound negative control whose
      endpoint exists before entry.
