# Spec: immutable Cardano Node master HEAD Antithesis candidate

Issue: #215. Parent epic: #214. Slug: `215-immutable-cardano-node-head-candidate`.

## Observable outcome

An operator dispatches one GitHub Actions workflow on the default branch and
observes a durable receipt describing exactly one Cardano Node `master` HEAD
candidate whose upstream SHA, published image digest, live binary revision, and
every rendered producer/relay image agree. No Antithesis request is made.

## P1 user story

As a Cardano Node fault-injection operator I run the manual candidate workflow
and read one receipt that names the resolved upstream SHA, the immutable
`tag@sha256:digest` candidate, the observed binary revision, and the uniform
rendered topology — or an honest failure naming the exact stage that stopped.

## Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| R-01 | Resolve `https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node.git` `refs/heads/master` exactly once per candidate and freeze the single observed full 40-hex SHA. |
| R-02 | Build the exact upstream Nix `dockerImage/node` output for that SHA and publish it under a full-SHA tag in the repository's own GHCR namespace. |
| R-03 | Record the published OCI digest and express candidate identity only as `<repository>:<40-hex-sha>@sha256:<64-hex>`. |
| R-04 | Prove the revision by executing the published image and reading the containerized `cardano-node` binary's own revision output. |
| R-05 | Render the `cardano_node_master` Compose model so that every producer and relay resolves to that one candidate reference, and verify uniformity on the resolved model rather than on file text. |
| R-06 | Validate the rendered model through Compose itself before the submission boundary. |
| R-07 | Expose one manually dispatchable GitHub Actions entrypoint that runs the production candidate path with a fake submission transport and publishes a durable candidate receipt. |
| R-08 | Emit a `CandidateReceiptV1` record at every stage, including honest failure records. |
| R-09 | Run the candidate-path tests in local and hosted CI, and document the manual recovery entrypoint. |
| R-10 | Keep the existing mixed-version `cardano_node_master` profile on disk and separately invokable. |

## Invariants

Each invariant states its observable failure and success meaning. Parent
invariants `E214-01..05` map as noted; `E214-06..09` belong to #216.

| ID | Invariant | Fails when | Holds when |
|---|---|---|---|
| I215-01 | Exactly one `master` observation yields one full SHA (E214-01) | zero, multiple, malformed, wrong-origin, or wrong-ref observation | stage `resolve-upstream` records exactly one 40-hex SHA and the receipt carries it |
| I215-02 | Candidate identity is full-SHA tag plus OCI digest (E214-02) | tag component differs from the resolved SHA, digest absent, or reference not `repo:40hex@sha256:64hex` | stage `publish-candidate` records a reference in exactly that form whose tag equals the resolved SHA |
| I215-03 | Live binary revision equals the resolved SHA (E214-03) | container cannot run, revision absent, unparsable, or different | stage `prove-revision` records the observed revision and it equals the resolved SHA |
| I215-04 | Every rendered producer/relay uses one identical immutable candidate (E214-04) | any expected node service missing, any node image unequal to the candidate, any stale release reference surviving, or a zero-row census | stage `verify-topology` records the complete expected service census with one distinct image equal to the candidate |
| I215-05 | The rendered model is Compose-valid | Compose validation of the rendered model fails or produces no services | stage `validate-compose` succeeds on the rendered model |
| I215-06 | No failed or ambiguous prerequisite reaches the submission boundary (E214-05) | the submission operation is invoked after any stage failure | the submission operation is invoked exactly once on the complete path and zero times in every negative control |
| I215-07 | No real Antithesis submission exists in this ticket | any real-submission transport operation exists, or the candidate path can reach anything outside its declared scratch | the transport operation surface equals the frozen model exactly, and the whole suite runs to green inside a container that grants the region no name for anything outside stdio and its scratch bind |
| I215-08 | One production code path | preparation or validation logic is duplicated per mode | the same controller runs in every mode and only the injected transport differs |
| I215-09 | Receipts are honest | a failing run emits a success outcome or omits its failing stage | each stage appends a `CandidateReceiptV1` record; a failure records `outcome=FAILED` with the failing stage and an error reason |
| I215-10 | Secrets never leak | any credential value appears in a receipt, log, fixture, brief, or document | credentials are passed only through the process environment of the effecting command |
| I215-11 | Every proof can fail | any named mutant in the shipped mutation harness leaves the suite green | the harness applies each named mutant, proves it applied, and the suite goes red for every one |

## Proof architecture (mandate v2)

The invariants above state what must hold. This section states how a proof of
them must be built, because a proof that cannot fail satisfies the table
vacuously.

- **The test double is a spy, not an oracle.** The fake transport records what
  it received. It must not derive an observation from the controller's own
  arguments where the invariant is about that argument's value. An expected
  value comes from the scenario fixture; the controller's input is evidence,
  never the expected answer.
- **Assertions name the reason, not just the stage.** A negative control that
  only proves "some failure occurred at stage X" passes for the wrong reason.
  Each control asserts the failing stage *and* its stable error token.
- **Rendered artifacts are witnessed.** Any operation that receives a rendered
  model must observably depend on that model's content; a scenario must fail
  when the controller passes a different path.
- **Reachability is read from the invocation log**, never from controller
  stdout or a claim.
- **The suite is deterministic.** A required command that is intermittently
  red is a failed command. Note in particular that
  `printf … | grep -q` under `set -o pipefail` fails when `grep` exits early
  and `printf` takes `SIGPIPE`.
- **Mutation survival is the acceptance criterion for the proofs themselves**
  (I215-11), and the harness that establishes it ships in the repository so it
  keeps running after this ticket closes.

### Findings become properties

An audit finding is not closed by a point fix. The commit owner converts every
finding into a **permanent property in the shipped suite** — the general rule
the finding is an instance of — so the same defect class cannot recur silently.
An auditor's own instrumentation is read-only seed evidence for that work; the
commit owner owns every shipped line of it. A repair that makes the exact
reported mutant red while leaving its class undetected has not closed the
finding.

## Rejection behavior

Every rejection is fail-closed: the controller writes the honest failure
receipt for its stage, exits non-zero, and performs no later stage. Rejected
conditions are those named in the invariant table above, plus an unsupported
mode, a non-executable transport, and a transport operation that exits non-zero.

## Observable success

- `tests/test-daily-cardano-node-head.sh` passes locally and in hosted CI, with
  one named scenario per invariant and per negative control.
- The manual workflow run produces a downloadable receipt containing the four
  agreeing identities and `outcome=PREPARED`.
- `testnets/cardano_node_master/docker-compose.yaml` is unchanged.

## Non-goals

- Scheduling, day claims, real MOOG transport, and terminal run receipts (#216).
- Changing Cardano Node source or upstream release workflows.
- Changing the Daily Amaru controller.
- Committing or merging any generated candidate consumer commit.

## I215-07 is proved by containment, not observation (mandate v3)

Four consecutive audits closed a named escape channel and found another:
one command name, then two syntactic invocation forms, then `execve`-only
tracing, then inherited descriptors and filesystem writes. Each repair was
correct and each was incomplete, because the mandate asked the wrong question.

**Enumerating egress channels does not terminate.** The set of ways a value can
leave a process is open-ended, and an observer written inside the region it
observes cannot bound what crossed into that region before it started. A proof
of this shape can always be defeated by a channel nobody listed, which makes it
a check that cannot be trusted however many channels it lists.

The invariant is therefore proved by **containment**:

- The complete suite runs inside an OS-enforced container with **no network
  access** and **no writable path outside its declared scratch root**; the
  repository tree is read-only to it.
- Green inside that container is the proof: the region has no name for anything
  it was not explicitly granted, so no enumeration is required and no future
  channel can defeat it. State the claim exactly — the region retains stdio and
  one writable scratch bind, both licensed here, so this is "no reach beyond
  what the wall grants", not "no bytes leave". Four campaigns were lost to a
  claim broader than its mechanism; do not restate one.
- The container is a **negative control of its own**: a seeded outbound
  connection and a seeded write outside scratch must each make the run fail,
  demonstrating the walls are real rather than assumed.
- If the container mechanism is unavailable, the suite **fails closed**. A
  skipped containment check is an absent check, and absence reads as green.
- The transport operation-surface equality against the frozen
  `functions-model.md` remains, unchanged: it proves no real-submission
  operation *exists*. Containment proves none is *reachable*.

Syscall-level observation is no longer required for this invariant and its
apparatus should be removed rather than kept alongside. It cost roughly 285
seconds per gate run while proving less than the walls do.

### The wall is constructed, not subtracted (mandate v3.1)

Three consecutive audits breached containment through a channel the wall did not
remove, because the wall was built by **subtracting** capabilities from a full
view of the host: fresh sockets denied, then inherited descriptors severed, then
namespaces unshared — while `--ro-bind / /` still exposed every pre-existing
rendezvous object in the filesystem. A read-only bind is not a containment
primitive for non-regular inodes: it returns `EROFS` for writes to regular
files, directories and symlinks, but leaves `connect()` on a pathname `AF_UNIX`
socket and `open(O_WRONLY)` on a FIFO permitted.

Subtraction has the same defect as enumeration one level down: it requires
knowing every capability to remove.

The wall is therefore **constructed**: the region starts from an empty
filesystem view and receives only explicit binds of what the suite genuinely
needs — the repository read-only, the scratch root writable, and the minimum
runtime paths. Nothing else is visible, so no pre-existing endpoint of any kind
is reachable by name, whether or not anyone anticipated it.

The negative-control set must include at least one seed whose endpoint exists
**before** entry but whose descriptor is acquired **inside by name**. Every
descriptor-bound control is blind to that family by construction, which is
exactly why three well-built control sets missed it.
